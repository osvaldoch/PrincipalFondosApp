/*!
 @unsorted
 @abstract This protocol provides meaningful and detailed notifications for the user to interact with when a custom camera overlay is used for scanning.

 A view controller that conforms to this protocol is responsible for specifying the UI elements and handling their actions.
 Once the capture manager (DMDSCaptureManager) has been initialised with a view controller that conforms to this protocol, you should then provide
 the view controller with access to the capture manager, so that it can be used to control the UI at various stages.
 This can be achieved by simply declaring a property of type DMDSCaptureManager within your view controller, and setting this once the capture manager is successfully initialised.
